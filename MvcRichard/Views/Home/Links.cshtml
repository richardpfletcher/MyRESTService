                      I wish to offer my humble gratitude to Donn Rochlin and David Gelfand. Don did all the music.David helped produce this CD. This CD is still in a primitive state. We are looking for someone

who would like to help with this project. I believe that poetry and music together can enhance the

poetic experience. It adds an extra layer of emotion. Unfortunately, in America poetry has taken a

back seat in our culture. Let's bring back the power of the spoken word.
